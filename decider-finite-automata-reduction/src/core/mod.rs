//! Definitions of the ingredients and validation of a proof that a given Turing Machine can't halt.
//! The Reproducibility and Verifiability Statement `[1]` requires a particular rigor here.
//! The core code strives to be simple and clearly correct (aside background terms and knowledge).
//! Then it's documented and unit tested anyway.
//! This eases the burden on advanced provers and SAT solvers: they can't have mistakes that matter.
